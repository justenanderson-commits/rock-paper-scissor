## Rock Paper Scissor Solo Project

### Abstract
This is a rock, paper, scissor (RPS) game that will offer players the ability to compete against the computer by clicking on a rock, paper, or scissor icon. The computer-player will then do the same and a winner will be determined. Wins will be tabulated in each player's column of the game board.

There will also be an advanced mode where the game can be played with additional objects/characters beyond the traditional RPS objects.

### Notes 
Though I've never heard of BEM before, I'm going to attempt to use its naming convention for my styling.

I realize my branching naming convention isn't working. I was trying to go by file type initially and now realize that the functionality is going to span multiple file types. So I'll try to name them differently from here on out. 

I'm sure thius wasn't the proper way to go about it, but I started by building the html and CSS. Then I created the data model and started connecting pieces of the DOM to manipulate it. For some reason that logic-process just made a little more sense to me.
