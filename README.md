## Rock Paper Scissor Solo Project

### Abstract
This is a rock, paper, scissor (RPS) game that will offer players the ability to compete against the computer by clicking on a rock, paper, or scissor icon. The computer-player will then do the same and a winner will be determined. Wins will be tabulated in each player's column of the game board.

There will also be an advanced mode where the game can be played with additional objects/characters beyond the traditional RPS objects.

### Notes 
Though I've never heard of BEM before, I'm going to attempt to use its naming convention for my styling.
